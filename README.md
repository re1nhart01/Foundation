# Foundation C++
 Flutter and React like framework over LVGL on C++




#IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT (I use it for myself)


# Foundation UI — Overview

Foundation UI is a declarative UI framework built on top of LVGL for ESP32-S3.  
It brings concepts inspired by React, Flutter, and SwiftUI into the embedded world:

- Components
- Virtual DOM–like VNodes
- Declarative props
- State with partial rerender
- Styling engine
- Navigation (StackNavigator)
- Refs for LVGL object access
- JSX-like DSL via macros

Goal: **high-level, reactive architecture for embedded UI development**.
